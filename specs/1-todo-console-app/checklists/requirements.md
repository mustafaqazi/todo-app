# Specification Quality Checklist: Phase I - Todo In-Memory Python Console App

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-29
**Feature**: ../spec.md
**Status**: ✅ VALIDATED - All items passing

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**All quality checks PASSED.** The specification is comprehensive, unambiguous, and ready for the planning phase.

**Key Strengths**:
- 5 clear, independently testable user stories with P1/P2 priorities
- 15 functional requirements with explicit command syntax
- 8 measurable success criteria with specific metrics
- 7 well-defined assumptions
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Clear scope boundaries with explicit out-of-scope items

**Next Steps**: Proceed with `/sp.clarify` (if needed) or `/sp.plan` to begin implementation planning.

## Notes

- Items marked complete: specification validates against all criteria
- No action items required before proceeding to planning phase
